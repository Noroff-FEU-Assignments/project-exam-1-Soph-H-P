          <p>Who is the weirdo that thought this blog was a good idea?</p>
          <p>Well, that would be me...</p>
          <p>
            I am not certainly not a writer, I am also not a blogger. I am a Zoologist and current
            Front-end Development student who has been tasked with creating a blog.
          </p>
          <p>
            So as a person who has a keenness for bugs and also coding. The obvious (ahem…) topic
            for this blog was of course both bugs and bugs.
          </p>
          <p>Humm… so, maybe not, but things to know about me if you really are interested:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I like being outside</li>
            <li>I believe coding to be the bees knees</li>
            <li>I like bugs</li>
            <li>I am a dog person</li>
          </ul>
          <p>And that is more than enough about me…</p>
        </div>

            Did you know that back in the day a bug in the system could literally be exactly that?
            Was this the first time a machine was de-bugged? I am afraid I can’t say for sure
            because I wasn’t there, however I would like to think so because that would be
            enjoyable.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the blog that nobody asked for, the blog that isn’t helping anyone achieve
            anything and the blog that could potentially make the odd person chuckle.
          </p>
          <p>“We need to bridge the gap between bugs and bugs. “ - no one</p>
          <p>
            This unnecessary blog is mostly designed to cause amusement, please do not take the blog
            posts too seriously, it is seriously just a bit of fun.
          </p>
          <p>Things you will learn from reading this blog:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              My thoughts about what bugs would be what bugs if they happened to be bugs in real
              life (confused yet?)
            </li>
            <li>Amusing bugs that seem to have coding errors/bugs</li>
            <li>Code that happens to look like bugs</li>
            <li>Anything else that seems moderately relevant to the subject</li>
